    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      "Miettes d'art" is an online store that aims to give women unique,
      fashionable and affordable jewelry. Every piece we design hides a story
      full of passion and emotions. That’s what makes our pieces worth wearing.
      We spend days searching for the finest material to ensure a timeless
      product. Our custom-made designs are gold or silver plated made with love.
      Our goal is far beyond designing earrings, we aim to tackle a wider
      palette of jewelry and small "objets d'art", all inspired by our
      background and taste. Here’s how it all started. Miettes d’art was founded
      in July 2020 by us, Sarah and Taymaa. We are speech therapists by day and
      jewelry creators by night! We first met during an internship in Toulouse,
      France. Back then, we discovered our common interest in handmade jewelry,
      especially earrings. With the economic collapse in our home country
      Lebanon, working in our field became more challenging. Out of ambition, we
      exchanged views on creating jewelry and came up with the idea of building
      an e-commerce jewelry hub. And here it is, “Miettes d’art”.
